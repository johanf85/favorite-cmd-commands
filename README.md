# favourite CMD commands

## ls

Just plain and simple but needed to show the contents of a folder

## nano <filename>

nano is a texteditor in which I am writing this right now

## git commit -m "Message"

Needed for committing files to the repository.

## git status

Handy to have an overview what is included in a commit and which files need to be added first.

## .

Use of the . comes in hand a lot.
